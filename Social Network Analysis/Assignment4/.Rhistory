# For the first part of this assignment you will analyze randomly
# generated graphs and determine which algorithm created them.
# Construct a function that determines if a graph was generated based
# on one of the following algorithms:
# Preferential Attachment ('PA')
# Small World with low probability of rewiring ('SW_L')
# Small World with high probability of rewiring ('SW_H')
# Examples of random graph generating functions:
g <- sample_pa(100)
